# First-Ever_Project

####I started my tech journey buying an O'neill python bundle from humble bundle in november 2021.

####In Januray 2022 I coded my first ever project a simple slots machine. The odds are fixed, and it is written poorly with a lot of repeated code.

####In february I made a version 2, making improvements, making the odss dynamic, added a few functions to reduce code lines.

####This code is badly writted and I find it it diffcult o look at, but I uploaded this repo for posperity, to show my starting point in my coding journey and see how much I have improved.
